                <p>W3Schools offers free online tutorials, references and exercises in all the major languages of the web. Covering popular subjects like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, Java, and many more.</p>
                <p>This is a quick and easy resource for remembering how to format simple html and css commands. I usually have a W3 schools tab open whenever I am working on a website. The website is simple to navigate and comes with lots of interactive examples</p>

            <p>The MDN Web Docs site provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and progressive web apps.</p>
            <p>Mozzilla's documentation is very through. I often use this site when trying to understand something more deeply. It can be a great reference when building complicated websites using javascript.</p>

            <p>Name: Stack Overflow</p>
            <p>Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their programming knowledge, and build their careers.</p>
            <p>Stack overflow is a user driven website where lots of very specific problems are discussed in an online forum type setting. I use this as a last resort, because most of the advice is unreliable. Often problems that seem similar require different solutions. If you can parse through the nonsense, then this site contains some gems of wisdom.</p>

            <p>Name: Geeks for Geeks</p>
            <p>A Computer Science portal for geeks. It contains well written, well thought and well explained computer science and programming articles, quizzes and practice/competitive challenges.</p>
            <p>Odds are whenever you type a simple programming question into a search engine, you can find an article by geeks for geeks on the first page. I don't use the website's navigation but I always find myself there while researching a problem.</p>

          <p>Name: Tutorials Point</p>
          <p>Tutorials Point is a leading Ed Tech company striving to provide the best learning material on technical and non-technical subjects.</p>
          <p>Despite the description, tutorials point seems to heavily cater toward technical tutorials. Usually the tutorials are simple enough that useful information can be gleamed from them without having to follow each step. This is another site that search engines always recommend, and with good results.</p>
