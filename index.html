                <p>Joe is surprisingly calm and rational. When not fighting, he’s more than happy to drink some ale with a new friend. 
                    He doesn’t get angry often, but when he does, he can be a berserker on the battlefield.</p>
                <p>Joe is much larger than the average human. While he is very slow, he makes up for it with the strength of his brute force.
                He usually wears either dark green or black, but never both at the same time. He wears light armor to protect himself from
                a hit, but usually he is very careful with it and keeps it in the best condition he can.</p>
